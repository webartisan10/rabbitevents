Let's imagine a use case: a User made a payment. You need to handle this payment, register the user, send him emails, send analytics data to your analysis system, and so on. The modern infrastructure requires you to create microservices that do their specific job and only it: one handles payments, one is for user management, one is the mailing system, one is for analysis. How to let all of them know that a payment succeeded and handle this message? The answer is "To use RabbitEvents".

Once again, the RabbitEvents library helps you publish an event and handle it in another app. It doesn't make sense to use it in the same app because Laravel's Events work better for that.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Attention version 7 users!** A new version 7.3.0 has been released with *ext-amqp* support (similar to version 8.2). Update for improved performance.

## Installation via Composer<a name="installation"></a>
You can use Composer to install RabbitEvents into your Laravel project:

```bash
composer require nuwber/rabbitevents
```

### Configuration<a name="configuration"></a>
After installing RabbitEvents, publish its config and a service provider using the `rabbitevents:install` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan rabbitevents:install
```

This command installs the config file at `config/rabbitevents.php` and the Service Provider file at `app/providers/RabbitEventsServiceProvider.php`.

The config file is very similar to the queue connection, but with the separate config, you'll never be confused if you have another connection to RabbitMQ.

```php
<?php
use Enqueue\AmqpTools\RabbitMqDlxDelayStrategy;

return [
    'default' => env('RABBITEVENTS_CONNECTION', 'rabbitmq'),
    'connections' => [
        'rabbitmq' => [

                'passphrase' => env('RABBITEVENTS_SSL_PASSPHRASE', ''),
            ],

                'prefetch_count' => env('RABBITEVENTS_QOS_PREFETCH_COUNT', 1),
            ]
        ],
    ],
    'logging' => [

    ],
];

## Upgrade from 7.x to 8.x<a name="upgrade_7.x-8.x"></a>

### PHP 8.1 required
RabbitEvents now requires PHP 8.1 or greater.

### Supported Laravel versions
RabbitEvents now supports Laravel 9.0 or greater.

### Removed `--connection` option from the `rabbitevents:listen` command
There's an issue [#98](https://github.com/nuwber/rabbitevents/issues/98) that still needs to be resolved.
The default connection is always used instead.

## RabbitEvents Publisher<a name="publisher"></a>

The RabbitEvents Publisher component provides an API to publish events across the application structure. More information about how it works can be found on the RabbitEvents [Publisher page](https://github.com/rabbitevents/publisher).

## RabbitEvents Listener<a name="listener"></a>

The RabbitEvents Listener component provides an API to handle events that were published across the application structure. More information about how it works can be found on the RabbitEvents [Listener page](https://github.com/rabbitevents/listener).

## Speeding up RabbitEvents<a name="speeding-up-rabbitevents"></a>
To enhance the performance of RabbitEvents, consider installing the `php-amqp` extension along with the `enqueue/amqp-ext` package. 
By doing so, RabbitEvents will utilize the `enqueue/amqp-ext` package instead of the default `enqueue/amqp-lib` package. 
This substitution is advantageous because the C-written `php-amqp` package significantly outperforms the PHP-written `enqueue/amqp-lib` package.

You can install the `php-amqp` extension using the following command:
```bash
pecl install amqp
```
or use the way you prefer. More about it can be found [here](https://pecl.php.net/package/amqp).

Next, install the `enqueue/amqp-ext` package with the following command:
```bash
composer require enqueue/amqp-ext
```
No additional configuration is required.

## Non-standard use <a name="#non-standard-use"></a>

If you're using only one part of RabbitEvents, you should know a few things:

1. You remember, we're using RabbitMQ as the transport layer. In the [RabbitMQ Documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-five-python.html), you can find examples of how to publish your messages using a routing key. This routing key is the event name, like `something.happened` from the examples above.

1. RabbitEvents expects that a message body is a JSON-encoded array. Every element of an array will be passed to a Listener as a separate variable. For example:
```json
[
  {
    "key": "value"  
  },
  "string",
  123 
]
```

There are 3 elements in this array, so 3 variables will be passed to a Listener (an array, a string, and an integer).
If an associative array is being passed, the Dispatcher wraps this array by itself.
